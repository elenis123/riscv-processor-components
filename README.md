# RISC-V Processor Components â€“ Homework 

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project was developed for the course **"Digital Hardware Systems at Low Logic Levels I"** at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)**. It includes modular implementations of key components of a simplified RISC-V processor using Verilog HDL.

The project is organized into five exercises, covering the design and simulation of an ALU, calculator module, register file, datapath, and a multicycle processor controller.
